## What if you never had to work again in your life?

That doesn't mean you wouldn't. . . but what if it was your choice:

* When you worked
* How long you worked
* Who you worked for

??

Passive Cash Flow (money that comes in every month no matter what) is the answer.

Want to start working towards that goal? Use this portolio calculator to figure 
out how long until you get there.

Step 1:

Identify how much passive cash flow you actually need to maintain the lifestyle you want.

1. Mortgage/monthly rent
2. Transportation
3. Food
4. Clothing
5. Entertainment
6. Other

OR if you already know the answer then just enter it.

Step 2:

Enter your:

* current_portfolio
* time_horizon (in years)
* monthly_contribution

This will generate how large your portfolio should be at that time.

Are you on track?
Do you need to make changes? (the easiest and most lucrative thing to change is how much you contribute each month).

Make adjustments to any/all of your assumptions until you find a plan that works for you.

To freedom!
